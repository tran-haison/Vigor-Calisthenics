      "description": "The Pull Up is a basic calisthenic exercise, which is a precondition for more advanced skills on the bar.\nProgression Goal: Build basic upper body strength for a Muscle Up.\n\nExecution:\nThe exercise starts in a dead hang. The movement is initialized through depressing and retracting the scapula. Next you pull yourself up by engaging your biceps and back muscles. Pull till your chin surpasses the bar (even better till your chest touches the bar). Descend slowly and controlled into a dead hang position. It is important to always perform the full range of motion.\n\nVariations:\nThe Chin-Up is done with an underhand grip in contrast to the overhand grip of the Pull-Up. With the underhand grip your elbows naturally bend more inwards, by what your biceps will be targeted to a greater extent. Instead of bars you can perform the Pull-Up also on rings.\n",

      "description": "A Handstand requires strength, flexibilty, balance and experience. Many people are able to kick up into a banana handstand, hold it for a few seconds and fall over. Starting from this, learning a proper straight line handstand, which can be balanced and hold easily is a great journey.\n\nExecution:\nPlace your hands on the floor shoulder wide apart. Press your shoulders down and to the side. Engage your core and keep your whole body in tension. Kick one leg up followed by the other one. Bring your body int to a straight line, point your toes, keep a hollow body position and balance it in this position. The balancing happens through your fingers, forearms and shoulders. If you are falling forward press yourself back through your fingertips, open and press your shoulders down. If you are falling backward lean a bit forward with your shoulders and push them down, also squeeze your legs and abs together.\n\nEntry: There are many ways to enter a handstand. Here are some possibilities:\n1. Kick Up\n2. Tucked Press\n3. Straddle Press\n4. Pike Press\n5. Frogstand to Handstand\n\nMobility: A good mobility will be very benefical for the handstand.\nShoulder Mobility: Shoulder mobility is essential to have a nice stacking of the joints. If you don't have enough shoulder mobility, you will have to compensate that by bending your hip rather than arching your back. Think of a hollow body position and slight posterior pelvic tilt.\nWrist Mobility: All of your weight will be on your wrists, so make sure to properly warm them up. Recovery on joints will take much longer than for muscles, so don't overdue it. If you have issues with your wrists or not enough mobility, you can use Parallets. They will help to reduce the stress on the wrists and less mobility is needed than on the floor.\n\nHand Placement and Balancing: Main balancing is done with the hands and fingers. Bigger adjustmens can be made through bending the ellbows or pushing through the shoulders. Your fingers can really make a difference so make sure to use them effectively. Your hand will have three touchpoints with the ground. Your bottom palm line, top palm line and your fingers. Your most weight should be on your bottom palm line. By pressing your fingers into the ground you can help yourself from falling over. Also make sure to spread your fingers wide apart, so you have a wider balancing area.\n\nExit: If you work on a free handstand you also need to know how to exit safely. There different strategies for that.\n1. The easiest is to just reverse the kick up, but what to do if you are about to fall over.\n2. You can exit sideways before really falling over. A bit like in a cartwheel.\n3. Unroll. This needs a bite more control and a forward roll as prerequesite. Pull your head in, bend your arms, tuck your legs and roll over your back.\nIf you can't exit properly yet, you can also start with an assistend handstand or a wall as help.",

While you keep your arms straight, depress (pull down) your shoulder blades. If you do it correctly your shoulders should move aways from your ears. Hold this position with a firm grip and tight core.",

Think of the Archer Pull Up, the support of the passive arm is reduced by extending the arm and shifting the weight to the active arm. For this exercise you have different options. If you have resistance bands, i suggest to use them. Alternatively you can just use an old towel. Grab the band or towel with your supporting arm. You can adjust the difficullty by grabing the band/towel lower. Also you can use the band in an other way as support. Step on the band with both feets. The advantage of this option is that you don't have to use a supporting arm and fully can concentrate on the real One Arm Pull Up movement. The disadvantage is that the support gets weaker as higher you get. If you don't want to use any equipment, just grab the forearm of your active arm. This will give you some support. You can reduce the support by putting your passive hand on your biceps or even your shoulder. But This progression is meant for the exercise ‘Little Assisted One Arm Pull Up'\n\nExecution:\nPrepare a resistance band or towel. Grab the bar with your active arm and the band with your supporting arm on elbow height of the active arm. You can increase the difficulty by grabing the band even lower or using a weaker band. Try to hang without the support of the passive arm. Initiate the movement by depressing (pulling down) the shoulder blade of your active arm. Bend the elbow of your active arm and pull yourself up until your passive shoulder touches the bar. Use the passive arm as support and pull with it only as needed.",

      "description": "The Downward Dog exercise is known from Yoga. The focus seems to be on stretching, but still it is a good starting point towards your handstand journey, because it brings benefit to several points. 1. it will help you strech your shoulders. The mobility to open your shoulders is very important for a good handstand. 2. it will get you comfortable on your hands. You will get a feeling for shifting weight on your hands without much load on your wrists. 3. done correctly it will help to mimic some relevant shoulder positioning as in a handstand. Your shoulders should be rotated outward and elevated, which means that the hands and shoulders press into the ground.\n\nExecution: Start in a an upper Push Up position. Move your hip back and up towards the sky, by pressing with your hands towards the floor and engaging your core. Your body should be in a V-shape position. Rotate your shoulder outwards, don't let them rotate inwards. Press your chest towards the ground. Keep your legs as straight as possible and if you can bring your heels towards the ground. If you are not flexible enough to straighten your legs, just keep them slightly bend.",

      "description": "The Pike Hold will give you the opportunity to safely experiment your ability and strength to hold yourself upwards down.\n\nExecution: First you will need something stable where you can put your feet on. This could be a box, chair, bench, ... You can start with a low elevation and work yourself up towards higher elevations. In doubt, a regular stable chair should do it. Kneel in front of the chair and put your hands on the floor. Climb your feet on top of the chair, while supporting yourself with your arms. You can keep your legs bend for the entry. If you can handle the weight on your hands, straighten your legs and your arms. The most important part for proper form is to have a straight upper body line. This means your hands, shoulders and hip should be right above each other. In order to get into this position you will need to open your shoulders and rotate them outwards. Press your arms towards the ground, which will get you a nice elevates scapula position. The hardest part will be to bring your hips into the staright line. Don't overestimate yourself by bringing the hip to far out, where you can't hold it anymore. Don't arch your back. Keep your core engaged in to the keep a posterior pelvic tilt. If you bring your head in, it will be easier to avoid an arched back and to open your shoulder. Try to look at your feet.\n\nVariations: You can decrease or increase the difficulty of the exercise by choosing a lower or higher elevation. It is also possible to put your knees on the elevation instead of your legs. This will make the exercise easier.",

      "description": "The Advanced Wall Handstand adds the balancing to the regular Wall Handstand. Goal is to touch the wall only if necessary to correct, so you can improve your balancing.\n\nExecution: There different entry strategies. You can just walk up the wall, with your front facing the wall. Keep your core engaged and don't arch your back. Keep your arms straight the whole time and push from your shoulders. The nearer your hands get towards the wall, the harder it gets. Also you will be challenged to keep your body straight. With an arched back you won't be able to come as close to the wall as with a hollow body position. So, if you walked up into a Wall Handstand and got comfortable, try to balance yourself without touching the wall. With your feet you can slightly push yourself away from the wall. Don't push too much or you will fall over. Also always keep it safe and have enough strength to exit safely. Especially if you are practicing the Wall Handstand with your front facing the wall. The main goal is to get comfortable balancing in the handstand. Also keep a proper form. Straight body, arms and legs. Press your shoulder into the floor, keep your core engaged and your legs squeezed together.\n\nVariations: To avoid an arched back handstand it is recommended to perform the Wall Handstand with your front facing the wall. It will be more challenging than just kickiing up wit your back facing the wall. Also you need to take care, to always be able to exit safely. This is a bit harder when your front is facing the wall, as you will need to have some strength left to walk down the wall, or if you are able roll out.",

      "description": "The One Arm Handstand is the ultimate expression of Handstand skills. It requires strength, flexibilty, balance and experience. Many people are able to kick up into a banana handstand, hold it for a few seconds and fall over. Starting from this, learning a proper straight line handstand, which can be balanced and hold easily is a great journey. Now imagine doing this on only one arm. This is much more harder. Not many people are able to perform this skill and achieving this is really remarkable.\n\nExecution: Go into a handstand. Squeeze your legs together. Shift your weight to one side. In control move one hand away from the floor. Keep proper Handstand form. This means Straight arms with elevated shoulders. Posterior Pelvic position. Really push hard with your active arm and shoulder, in order to avoid your body from rotating.\n\nEntry: There are many ways to enter a handstand. Here are some possibilities:\n1. Kick Up\n2. Tucked Press\n3. Straddle Press\n4. Pike Press\n5. Frogstand to Handstand\n\nMobility: A good mobility will be very benefical for the handstand.\nShoulder Mobility: Shoulder mobility is essential to have a nice stacking of the joints. If you don't have enough shoulder mobility, you will have to compensate that by bending your hip rather than arching your back. Think of a hollow body position and slight posterior pelvic tilt.\nWrist Mobility: All of your weight will be on your wrists, so make sure to properly warm them up. Recovery on joints will take much longer than for muscles, so don't overdue it. If you have issues with your wrists or not enough mobility, you can use Parallets. They will help to reduce the stress on the wrists and less mobility is needed than on the floor.\n\nHand Placement and Balancing: Main balancing is done with the hands and fingers. Bigger adjustmens can be made through bending the ellbows or pushing through the shoulders. Your fingers can really make a difference so make sure to use them effectively. Your hand will have three touchpoints with the ground. Your bottom palm line, top palm line and your fingers. Your most weight should be on your bottom palm line. By pressing your fingers into the ground you can help yourself from falling over. Also make sure to spread your fingers wide apart, so you have a wider balancing area.\n\nExit: If you work on a free handstand you also need to know how to exit safely. There different strategies for that.\n1. The easiest is to just reverse the kick up, but what to do if you are about to fall over.\n2. You can exit sideways before really falling over. A bit like in a cartwheel.\n3. Unroll. This needs a bite more control and a forward roll as prerequesite. Pull your head in, bend your arms, tuck your legs and roll over your back.\nIf you can't exit properly yet, you can also start with an assistend handstand or a wall as help.",

Bring yourself in a standing position again, while still balancing on one foot.\n\nVariations: If the exercise is too hard, start from the bottom and push yourself up. This way you will remove the eccentric part of the movement, until you have enough strength to do the full thing. Another way to make it easier, is to place an elevation on the ground. When your knee touches the elevation, push yourself up again. This will reduce the range of motion but includes also the important exccentric part of the movement.",

Partly it is the same movement pattern as the Hefesto, but limited in the range of motion and therefore much easier and a good start. Nevertheless it is already an intermediate exercise which requires solid strength, especially in the shoulders and arms. Also the exercise is stressfull to the joints, so don't overdue it.\n\n\nExecution\n\nStep 1: Start by sitting on a bar and grab it with a supinated grip (palms facing forward). Your wrists should be rotate slightly backwards instead forward, so you can keep a strong grip, while descending your body. Arms are straight.\n\nStep 2: Slowly descend with your body, while keeping your back close to the bar and your feet behind yourself. Your back will arch naturally, which is ok. Still keep the tension in your core and don't overarch. Keep your elbows inward, also during the push phase.\n\nStep 3: Bottom position is reached when your arms are in a 90° angle or lower. Hold this position briefly.\n\nStep 4: Push yourself up, while keeping your back close the bar. An arched back is necessary to get the backward rotation around the bar. Also don't loosen your grip and think of rotating it backwards.\n\nStep 5: Back at the top your arms should be straight and your scapula depressed (pushing downwards). Pause there briefly without sitting on the bar and go for the next rep.\n\n\nVariations\n\nMake it easier:\n1. Use a band for assistance.\n2. Use a bar where you can support yourself with your legs.\n3. Reduce the range of motion. Don't descend to 90° if it is too hard.\n4. Use a pronated grip (palm facing backward)\n\nMake it harder:\n1. Descend below 90°, as low as you can.\n2. Increase the distance between the bar and your back.\n3. Perform Archer Korean Dips, which means using a wider grip and descending towards one side.",

If you don't have a resistance band you can still progress with the progressions on lower levels or you can ask somebody to support you by grabing your feet and help pushing you up.\n\n\nExecution\n\nStep 1: Prepare the band support. There are 2 ways to use a resistance band for help. 1. you can double it and put it on your hip, while holding it firmly with your hands. 2. Wrap it around the bar and step in with your feet. Resistance bands are available in different strengths. Chooe the one which fits you best and progress to lighter ones.\n\nStep 2: Start by sitting on a bar and grab it with a supinated grip (palms facing forward). Your wrists should be rotate slightly backwards instead forward, so you can keep a strong grip, while descending your body. Arms are straight. Use the resistance band as described in step 1.\n\nStep 3: Slowly descend with your body, while keeping your back close to the bar and your feet behind yourself. Your back will arch naturally, which is ok. Still keep the tension in your core and don't overarch.\n\nStep 4: Descend even further by bringing your shoulder and back further away from the bar.\n\nStep 5: Lower yourself by slowly extend your arms until they are straight and a German Hang with supinated grip is reached.\n\nStep 6: When the bottom position is reached, pull hard by bending your arms and try to bring your upper back towards the bar. Think of pulling the bar towards your arm pits\n\nStep 7: The higher you get you will have to rotate your elbows over the bar. Therefore arching the back will be necessary to some extend.\n\nStep 8: Bring your upper back to touch the bar for the rep to count.",

This will give you the support to change your grip for the Hefesto. Then you can rotate backwards to the German Hang position.\n\nStep 2: Your wrists should be rotate slightly backwards instead forward, so you can keep a strong grip. Arms are straight.\n\nStep 3: Initiate the movement by depressing and protracting your scapula. This means to push your shoulder blades down and forward. Think of trying to squeeze your shoulder together.\n\nStep 4: Pull hard by bending your arms and try to bring your upper back towards the bar.

Please consider: Don't overstretch or push through pain. Low intensity stretching show better results in range of motion than moderate or high intensity stretching.\n\n\nExecution\n\nStep 1: Start in a sitting position with your legs spread over 90° and your back straight. If you can't do this, you should work on the Butterfly stretch or Middle Split stretches.\n\nStep 2: Slowly bring your upper body towards the floor through bending from the hip. Keep a straight back by doing a anterior pelvic tilt. This means rotate your hip forward instead allowing it to rotate back and round your back.\n\nStep 3: At your lowest point hold this position and breath into it. At exhale you can try to push a bit deeper into the stretch. Also it helps if you can hold yourself onto something, so you don't have activly to fight against gravity that hard.",
